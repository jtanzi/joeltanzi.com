## 4 Ways to Avoid Having to Search for That Thing You Need

If you’ve ever searched in vain for that one tool you need for a DIY project you’re working on, then you probably can appreciate why you should organize your tools. It’s hard enough to find the time to get going on a project without finding yourself spending much of it just finding what you need. And if you’re a professional who uses tools in your everyday work, it's detrimental to your productivity to stop what you’re doing to search for the next thing to continue the job.
It’s important to recognize that not all tool organization systems are going to be the same. Depending on what tools you have around, from small hand tools to table saws, there won’t be a one-size fits all approach to every situation. But there are a set of tips you can draw from that will help you in most cases.

### Step 1: Inventory and Categorize
First, take an inventory of all your tools. Sort them into categories. For example, hand tools, power tools, saws, clamps, etc. 

### Step 2: Create a Space for Storage
Set up a “home” for each of these categories of tools where they will always be when you’re not using them. You could build a cabinet out of spare lumber hanging around on which to hang tools. Use pegboard to create a wall space for hanging tools. Try to keep categories of tools you use together close to each other. For example, try keeping clamps for a table saw near the table saw, to reduce the time needed to set things up when you need to saw something. Build a DIY workbench with the space you need for storage in mind.

### Step 3: Maximize Vertical and Open Space Storage
Try to keep as much as possible out in the open, where you can see it.  Make use of wall space where you can. You can install a slat wall system or pegboard for mounting bins and baskets for storing things. Make these transparent so you can easily identify what’s inside. Use wall strips with anchor hooks to hang miscellaneous tools in plain sight. Use the end space on cabinets and workbenches to install some scrap wood with holes drilled in it to store screwdrivers or other tools.

### Step 4: Use Containers
Some tools just won’t work on a wall or other hanging space. When you have to store them in a container, make sure you label these. Also, separate nuts and bolts by size and store them in transparent containers like jars.
After following these steps, you should be grabbing what you need for a job quickly and easily, and finding yourself much more productive!
