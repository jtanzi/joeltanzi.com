# Portfolio Site for Joel Tanzi - Content Writer

This site is built in Jekyll [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [a Jekyll version of the Forty theme](https://gitlab.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) originally created by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) and ported to Jekyll by [Andrew Banchich](https://gitlab.com/andrewbanchich).

# Configuration

* The contact form is integrated with **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)** - just add your email to the `_config.yml`.
* Use `_config.yml` to **set whether the homepage tiles should pull pages or posts**, as well as how many to display.
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer!
* Set **featured images** in front matter.

# Repository and Hosting

The respository is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jtanzi/joeltanzi.com).

The site is being hosted on GitHub Pages as a project site at [joeltanzi.com](https://joeltanzi.com).

Domain management is through [Namecheap](www.namecheap.com).

# Issues with the Theme

If you would like to report a bug, ask a question, request a feature, feel free to do so on [the GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) and I will be more than happy to help!

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
